## Hello 👋🏼, I'm Isfar Baset

I'm a Data Scientist and Engineer with a passion for problem-solving, machine learning, and analytics. Currently pursuing my Master's in Data Science and Analytics at Georgetown University, I have experience working with data-driven decision-making across industries like Automotive, Finance, and Tech.

Beyond work, I enjoy exploring new restaurants, hosting memorable dinner parties, strategizing over board games, and curating minimal yet engaging content for social media.
